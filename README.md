This is one of two repos for this project.  
You will find the backend repo [here](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/2209-wns-rivest-groupe3-back)

## _Technos_

- Frontend:

  - React
  - Typescript
  - Vite
  - Apollo Client
  - GraphQL

- Backend:
  - PostgreSQL
  - TypeORM
  - Apollo server
  - GraphQL
  - Typescript

## **Directory structure**

```bash
-- yourProjectFolderName
    | -- front
          | .git
    | -- back
          | data
          | .git
```

_Directory names must be 'front' and 'back'_  
_The `data` folder is important for database volume mapping, and data persistance in your dev process. You must create it yourself_

<br>

âžœ To make your code editor happy, remember to install dependencies locally in both folders

<br>

### Running docker containers for development

From within the front directory run :

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

_add '-d' flag to dismiss logs and free up terminal window if necessary_

## **Frontend**

<br>

Once docker compose is up, frontend app will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## **Backend**

Once docker compose is up, backend will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
